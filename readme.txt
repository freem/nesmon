1. Introduction
================================================================================
nesmon is a machine code monitor for the NES/Famicom. The platform is an odd
choice, but I really wanted to see if it could be done.

It is highly unlikely that you will be able to use this in a full project.

================================================================================
2. Important Notes
================================================================================
Multiple versions of the monitor can be assembled. The versions are different
based on cart configuration.

Included profiles:
* NROM (Mapper 000)
* Sunsoft FME-7 (Mapper 069)
* Nintendulator Debugging Mapper (Mapper 100)

================================================================================
3. Usage
================================================================================
Holding Start+Select on controller 1 for 3 seconds will reboot the monitor.
