nesmon Editor
=============
Despite being just a "simple line editor", the Editor is nesmon's core module.

In order to simplify code, a number of sacrifices are made:
* No buffering of previous text, meaning you can't run previous lines easily.
* Due to the above, the cursor can only be moved left/right.
* Line length is limited to 30 characters (one tile on each side for margin).
