Hardware Keyboard Information
=============================
As nesmon is an assembly language monitor, having a keyboard is the best option
for input. However, unlike the PC world, the NES/Famicom have a few competing
keyboard styles.

Family BASIC Keyboard
=====================
The official keyboard.
Only available in Japan and only easily usable on a Famicom.
Less keys than a regular keyboard, but allows for entering Japanese Kana.

Other Keyboards

FCEUX's source code makes reference to a "pec586kb".
I would document this, but the same source has this comment:
"TODO: check all keys, some of the are wrong".

Would rather not spread wrong information further.
